# Mutation

This is a project that is inspired by [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKortajF2dPBWMIS6KF4RLtQiG6KQrTdB).

The gist of it is that this program simulates mutations and how they 
happen in the real world. Of course, this is a simple simulation where
the organisms spawn, replicate, mutate, and die at a percentage defined 
by a programmer, not nature or actual biological events. It's merely meant
to be something for me to mess around with, as I had been wanting to since
I saw the first video in the linked video series. Enjoy and have fun
balancing this simulation of life.`
